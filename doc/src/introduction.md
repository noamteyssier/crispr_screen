## Introduction

`crispr_screen` is a free, open-source command-line tool that enables easy and
efficient differential expression analysis for CRISPR screens.

It is a faithful recreation of the `MAGeCK` algorithm, which is a form of the
`DESeq` method specifically applied for CRISPR screens. This tool extends the
`MAGeCK` algorithm with the `MAGeCK-INC` method, but also implements the `Î±RRA`
algorithm described in the original `MAGeCK` paper.

It is a drop-in replacement of current differential expression analyses that is
faster, more stable, and easier to use.
